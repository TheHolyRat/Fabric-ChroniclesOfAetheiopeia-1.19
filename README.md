# The Chronicles of Aetheiopeia

## Concept

The Chronicles of Aetheiopeia is a fabric mod for 1.19.4 that aims to implement a multiverse's worth of new mechanics, items, mobs, blocks, and most importantly, LORE. This is all done to simulate an imaginary land called Aetheiopeia that no one has ever heard of. The goal of the mod is to become an Immortal.

#### v???:
• Leveling system- applies to items and entities that haven’t eclipsed transcendent power. Examples include weapons, food, monsters, people, organizations, guilds, dungeons, and settlements. Has ranks named after minerals with increasing power per level.
• Skills, level them to interact with certain parts of the world.
• Daily quests. Completing them gives you no rewards, but increases your reputation in the eyes of the Immortals. This reputation is traded for items with the Immortals' delegates.
• Major bosses- Immortals. Drop overpowered items. Lowers your reputation with the Immortals when killed.
• Death mechanics- when you die, you are sent to either hell or heaven. Your items are stored in a tombstone generated next to your spawnpoint. You have a higher chance of going to hell when you first start out. To improve the chance of going to Heaven to 50%, you have to complete quests given to you each day by the Immortals. Each has seven levels- first level of hell is the least dangerous and first level of Heaven is least blessed. Hell gets worse the deeper you go and Heaven gets better the deeper you go. Hell will force you to fight through hordes of monsters to return to the overworld and Heaven will just give you gifts and send you on your way.
